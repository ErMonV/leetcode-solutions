This repository documents my practice on **LeetCode** to strengthen my skills in **data structures** and **algorithms**, with the goal of improving my preparation for **technical interviews** and enhancing my problem-solving logic.

---

## 🛠️ Tecnologías utilizadas
- **Python 3** (main language)
- **C++** (for solutions more oriented toward memory and time efficiency)

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

The repository is organized by algorithm topics:

```text
📂 leetcode-practice/
│── 📂 arrays/
│ └── two_sum.py
│── 📂 dynamic_programming/
│ └── climbing_stairs.py
│── 📂 graphs/
│ └── number_of_islands.py
│── 📂 strings/
│ └── valid_palindrome.py
│── 📄 README.md
```

Each folder contains problems related to the corresponding category.Cada carpeta contiene problemas relacionados con la categoría correspondiente.  

---

## 🎯 Solution Approach

Each solution includes:

1. **Implemented code** (in Python or C++).
2. **Explanation of the strategy** used (with comments in the code or in a separate `.md`).
3. **Time and space complexity analysis** (`O(n)`, `O(log n)`, etc.).
4. **Possible improvements** or alternative solutions.

## 📊 Progress of Solved Problems

I’m currently keeping track of the solved problems:

| # | Problem                                                               | Topic   | Difficulty | Language | Status |
| - | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | -------- | ------ |
| 1 | [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)                     | Arrays  | Easy       | Python   | ✅      |
| 9 | [Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/) | Strings | Easy       | Python   | ✅      |

*(The table will be updated as I solve more problems)*

## 🚀 Future Goals

* Maintain consistent practice with problems of different levels.
* Solve problems in **Python and C++** to master different approaches.
* Document key learnings and strategies that could be useful for interviews.
* Reach **100+ solved problems** as an initial milestone.
